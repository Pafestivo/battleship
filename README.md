# battleship
The project started as building a simple battleship game to practice the TDD approach, but I ended up testing and learning more subjects along the way.<br>
In the different branches you will find other features I've been playing around with, such as:<br>
Connecting the game to different APIs to practice fetching and working with APIs<br>
Drag and drop feature on pc and mobile as an alternative method of placing the ships in the beginning
